## Description
Since 1992 over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered outside our solar system. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) maintains a publicly accessible archive of the data collected on these in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The objective of the NASA Exoplanet Query app is to make this data available for simple queries by its users.

## Features

- Retrieve various attributes of exoplanets, including names, discovery methods, orbital parameters, and more.
- Filter and sort exoplanet data based on user-defined criteria.
- User-friendly interface for querying and displaying data.
- Automatically fetches and updates data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

## Full Stack Application with React and Spring Boot

NASAExoPlanetQuery is a comprehensive full-stack application that leverages React for both the frontend and backend components. Additionally, Spring Boot is employed to create the RESTful API that serves as the bridge between the frontend and the exoplanet data retrieved from NASA's Exoplanet Archive.

### Frontend and Backend with React

This application showcases the versatility of React by utilizing it not only for the frontend but also for the backend. The frontend, built using React, offers a dynamic and interactive user interface for querying exoplanet data. This is achieved through React's component-based architecture and state management capabilities.

Furthermore, the backend logic is also implemented with React. By using technologies like `react-router` and custom API routing, we've created a unified codebase that handles both frontend and backend functionalities within the same React application. This approach simplifies development and deployment processes while maintaining a consistent development environment.

### RESTful API with Spring Boot

Spring Boot comes into play to create a robust RESTful API that facilitates communication between the React frontend and the data stored in NASA's Exoplanet Archive. Through Spring Boot's capabilities, we've designed and built a well-structured API that provides endpoints for querying exoplanet data based on user-defined criteria.

The Spring Boot API fetches real-time data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information. This integration between the frontend and the Spring Boot backend ensures smooth data flow and a seamless user experience.
